# hello-world
May 2023 Cohort

I am an aspiring Software Developer. I am undergoing a second attempt at Code:You; originally apart of the August 2023 cohort, I passed all modules but did not finish the final project in time. This go around, I plan to manage my time better and escalate to the team as needed for support/guidance. I am confident I will do better this time and am excited to have another opportunity.
